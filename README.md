# HealthyLivingOptimized
This web app is designed to help you find the optimal lifestyle for you! So many workout and diet plans are out there that assume one size fits all for lifestyle, but we are taking a revolutionary approach to health by incorporating Machine Learning to help you find the optimal balance of diet, exercise and sleep for your goals!

# Goal of the App
Make creating a healthy lifestyle easy, personalized, and free! Many great workout and diet plans exist behind pay walls, or are too general to be effective for everyone.  They work for some people, but others don't seem to see the same benefits. With HealthyLivingOptimized, you can create your own exercise and nutrition plans to help you achieve your fitness and lifestyle goals. With cutting age Machine Learning technology at your finger tips, HealthyLivingOptimized will continue to improve and tailor exercise and nutrition plans based on your feedback and goals, helping you live your optimal lifestyle.

# Tech Stack
While this is subject to change, the databases will be hosted in the cloud on AWS using Amazon RDS and either Amazon DynamoDB or MongoDB for the NoSQL database later on in development.  The ML backend will run in Python using Sci-kit Learn, hosted on either Amazon EC2 or Amazon Sagemaker.  The web app itself is still TBD, but will be hosted on EC2 or containerized on ECS (if time).  However, if time is running slim, we will likely create an Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions to interact with our database backend and run API calls via PostMan.

# Team Dynamic
I am looking to create a team of 2-3 engineers to help assist in this project.

# NoSQL Database type
TBD
